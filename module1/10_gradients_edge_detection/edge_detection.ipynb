    "## Canny Edge Detector\n",
    "- While image gradients tend to be important building blocks for more advanced techniques like the Canny edge detector\n",
    "- An edge is defined as a discontuinity in pixel intensity or more simply a sharp difference and change in pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of edges in an image \n",
    "- **Step Edge**: Forms when there is an abrupt change in pixel intensity from one side of the discontuinity to the other.\n",
    "- **Ramp Edge**: Change in pixel intensity is not instantenous. Instead, the change in pixel valye occurs a short but finite distance.\n",
    "- **Ridge Edge**: Occurs when image intensity abruptly changes and then return to initial value after a short distance.\n",
    "- **Roof edge**: Unlike the ridge edge where there is short, finite plateau at the top, roof edge has no such plateau. Its like a tip of an arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in Canny edge detection:\n",
    "- **Gaussian smoothing**: We want to ignore the much of the detail and focus on actual structure, thus we apply smoothing.\n",
    "- **Gradient orientation and magnitude**: Quite susceptible to noise and does not make for the best edge detector. Thus, two more steps.\n",
    "- **Non-maxima suppression (Edge thinning)**: For a given region, there should be only one edge response.\n",
    "    - Compute $G$ and $\\theta$ at each pixel in the image.\n",
    "    - Compare the current(center) pixel in the region to the 3x3 neighbour surrounding it\n",
    "    - Determine which direction Orientation is pointing. If orientation towards\n",
    "        - North/south, examine north and south magnitudes.\n",
    "        - East/west, examine east and west magnitudes\n",
    "    - If center pixel intensity > both the pixels being compared to, keep it, else discard center pixel.\n",
    "- **Hysteresis thresholding**: To remove regions of an image that are still not technically edges, we need to define two thresholds: $T_{lower}$ and $T_{upper}$\n",
    "    - Any gradient value $G > T_{upper}$ is sure to be an edge(strong edge)\n",
    "    - Any gradient value $G < T_{lower}$ is not an edge, so discard\n",
    "    - Any gradient value that is $T_{lower}< G< T_{upper}$, must undergo two more tests\n",
    "        - If particular edge connected to strong edge, then pixel is an edge.\n",
    "        - If the gradient pixel is not connected to a strong edge the discard it."
