    "# PIPELINE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Structuring your initial dataset\n",
    "- We need images themselves as well as labels associated with each image. \n",
    "- Number of images for each category should be uniform. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Splitting our dataset\n",
    "- Need to split dataset into two parts:\n",
    "    - Training set is used by classifier to learn what each category looks like by making predictions on input data and the correct it when predictions are wrong\n",
    "    - Test set is used to evaluate performance. No tuning of hyperparameters\n",
    "    - Validation set: This split comes from training data, and we can tune our hyperparamters\n",
    "- Training and testing data should not overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Feature extraction\n",
    "- Commo choices of features include:\n",
    "    - Color histograms (10.3)\n",
    "    - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (10.8) \n",
    "    - Local binary patterns (10.7)\n",
    "- And pretty much every other descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Training your classifier\n",
    "- Make classifier to learn how to recognize each of the categories in our label data. \n",
    "- Algorithms like SVM, Dtree, Random Forest Classifier are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Evaluation\n",
    "- For each feature vector in our testing set, we present them to our classifier and ask it to predict its label. \n",
    "- We compute number of predictions our classifier got right and compute aggregate reports such as precision, recall, and f-measure."
