    "# SIFT\n",
    "- Local feature desriptors are broken down into two phases\n",
    "- The first phase indentifies interesting, salient regions of an image that should be described and quantified. These regions are called keypoints and may correspond to edges or \"blob\"-like structures of an image.\n",
    "- Then we extract and quantify the local region surrounding each keypoint. The feature vector associated with a keypoint is called local feature.\n",
    "- Same [paper](https://gurus.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lowe_1999.pdf) as DoG\n",

    "## How it works\n",
    "- SIFT feature detector requries a set of input keypoints. \n",
    "- Step 1:\n",
    "    - For each of the input keypoints, SIFT takes the 16x16 pixel region surrounding the center pixel of the keypoint region.\n",
    "    - From there, we divide the 16x16 region into sixteen 4x4 pixel windows.\n",
    "- Step 2: \n",
    "    - For each of the 16 windows, we compute the gradient magnitude and orientation, just like we did for the HOG desecriptor.\n",
    "    - Given the gradient magniture and orientation, we construct an 8-bin histogram for each of the 4x4 pixel windows.\n",
    "    - Basically, we can take it this way:\n",
    "        - In a particular neighborhood of 4x4, we have each pixel having its own gradient magnitude $G$ and $\\theta$.\n",
    "        - We construct a histo graph, where number of orientations, .ie., bins, we want to consider is 8. Each bin has an interval of 20 degrees. \n",
    "        - We loop through each pixel in the region, and add the gradient magnitude value to bin that corresponds to the pixel orientation. \n",
    "        - However, instead of raw magnitude, the algorithm utilizes Gaussian weighting,.ie., the farther the pixel is from keypoint center, less it contirbutes to overall histogram.\n",
    "- Step 3:\n",
    "    - Collect all 16 of these 8-bin orientation histograms and concatenate them together.\n",
    "    - Given that we have 16 of these histogram, for each keypoint, we end up with a feature vector of $16*8=128-dim$\n",
    "    - After concat, we L2-normalize the entire feature vector.\n",
    "    - SIFT feacture vector is finished and ready to be compared to other SIFT feature vectors.\n",
    "- Local descriptors return N feature vectors per image, where N is number of detected keypoints.\n",
    "- This implies, if we get a 128-dim feature vector per keypoint, we end up with Nx128-dim feature vectors per image"
